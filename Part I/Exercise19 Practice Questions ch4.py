'''
1. [] is to create a list, its a empty list value
2. to assign 'hello' in the third variable is by spam[2] = 'hello'
3. 'd' ( (Note that '3' * 2  is the string '33' , which is passed to int()  before being divided by 11 . This eventually evaluates to 3 . Expressions can be used wherever values are used.)
4. 'd'
5. 'a','b'
6. bacon.index('cat') evaluates to 1
7. bacon.append(99) looks like [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99].
8. bacon.remove('cat') looks like [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99].
9. for list concantenation it is '+' and for replication its is '*'.
10. append() adds a item at the end of the list/index whereas insert() adds item to a specific index.
11. two ways to remove value from list is by : list.remove() method and del statment
12. list and strings are similar in someways like: get a specfic index, slicing, finding the length, using for loops, using in and not in operators
13. list and tuples are different because list are mutable and tuples are immutable.
14. to write a single tuple value --> m = (42,)
15. we can use the list() and tuple() functions . like tuple([8,9,0]) and list[(3,5,76)].
16. varibles that contain list values are not stored as list rather they are stored as reference.
17. copy.copy() helps to copy the list and copy.deepcopy helps to copy the lists inside the lists also.
